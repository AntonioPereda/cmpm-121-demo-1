This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Design Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress wit git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

####CHANGELOG####

- !!STEP 4 WIP COMPLETE!!
- Replaced stepInterval w/ requestAnimationFrame to have constant click growth set with device framerate
    - The amount a cookie increases per second is now contained within a variable
- Total number of clicks displayed on the button now display remains the same, but behind the scenes is a trunkated floating point number
